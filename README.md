## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

Working with box-shadows and arbitrary values for fine-tuning

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

**input.css:**
```css
shadow-[6px_6px_0px_black]
```
6px	Horizontal offset → pushes shadow right
6px	Vertical offset → pushes shadow down
0px	Blur radius → sharp edge (no blur)
black	Shadow color
